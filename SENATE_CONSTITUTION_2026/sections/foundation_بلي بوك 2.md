### 🚀 COPY THIS PROMPT BELOW:

```markdown
ACT AS: Senior Solutions Architect & Engineering Manager (The Senate Council).
CONTEXT: I am initiating a new "FAANG-Tier" web platform named [PROJECT_NAME] for the [INDUSTRY_TYPE] industry.
INPUT: Please analyze the attached "Constitution Files" (GUIDE, MINIMAL, ENTERPRISE, TEMPLATES, MATRIX, MAPS).

OBJECTIVE:
You are to orchestrate the execution of this project from absolute zero to "Supreme" production readiness. Your output must be a strict, hallucination-free Execution Plan that strictly adheres to the attached standards.

TASK 1: STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
- Consult `DOMAIN_STRATEGY_MATRIX.md`.
- Identify the specific "Psychological Triggers" and "Must-Have Features" for [INDUSTRY_TYPE].
- Define the "Golden Rule" for this specific project.

TASK 2: THE 18-PHASE EXECUTION MAP
- Generate a detailed, step-by-step checklist based on `GUIDE.md` (Phases 1-18).
- For each phase, provide:
  - **Goal**: One sentence summary.
  - **Critical Terminal Commands**: Exact `npm` or `npx` commands.
  - **Key Files to Create**: Paths and purposes.
  - **"Senate Wisdom"**: A pro-tip from `MINIMAL_PACK.md` or `ENTERPRISE_PACK.md` relevant to this phase (e.g., "Don't use `any`", "LCP < 2.5s").

TASK 3: "OPERATION ECLIPSE" & "CYBORG" INTEGRATION
- Explicitly plan where to inject `StatusPulse` and `CrystalConcierge` (from `OPERATION_ECLIPSE_EXECUTION_MAP.md`).
- Explicitly plan where to inject PWA, CMD+K, and Confetti (from `CYBORG_ARSENAL_EXECUTION_MAP.md`).

TASK 4: FILE SCAFFOLDING
- Provide a Bash script or a series of commands to generate the "Golden File Structure" as defined in `FUTURE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md`.

CONSTRAINTS:
1. **Tech Stack**: Strict adherence to Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind v4, Neon Postgres, Drizzle ORM, Clerk Auth, Shadcn/UI (Radix). NO OTHER STACKS.
2. **Quality**: "It works" is not enough. It must be "Supreme".
3. **Language**: Respond in a mix of professional English for technical terms and clear instructions.

START NOW by analyzing the Input Files and presenting the "Strategic Alignment" (Task 1).
```

### 💡 Pro Tips for Execution:

1.  **Iterative Mode**: After the AI responds to Task 1, reply with "Proceed to Task 2 Phase 1-4". Don't ask for all 18 phases at once; it will degrade quality.
2.  **Code Generation**: When asking for code, say: *"Generate [Component Name] following the [MINIMAL_PACK.md](file:///c:/Users/acer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/596ddf4f-ed45-46e3-8f70-9a9a74633cc3/MINIMAL_PACK.md) Micro-Prompt standards."*
3.  **Error Handling**: If an error occurs, paste the error and say: *"Consult [MINIMAL_PACK.md](file:///c:/Users/acer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/596ddf4f-ed45-46e3-8f70-9a9a74633cc3/MINIMAL_PACK.md) Runbooks/Debugging section and fix this."*
